=========================

Project to Implement the Jajodia-Mutchler voting algorithm.


Steps to Run the program:
==========================

The server files are to be copied to a total of 8 different machines (8 Servers )


The command to run the server:
==============================
Before running the server, 8 folders, one corresponding to each server must be created in the file system. All these 8 folders must be in the same location.Files folder must be placed in each server folder and it should be same across all the servers.

gcc -pthread server.c
./a.out <server_id> <port_no>   (server_id denotes the server number and it must be a number from 0 to 7)




Important points to remember
============================

Each excution of servers will write an entry(ip address and the port number) into the config files(placed in config folder at root).
servers will write in serverconfig.txt

Prior to next execution, the contents of serverconfig.txt files must be manually deleted.
